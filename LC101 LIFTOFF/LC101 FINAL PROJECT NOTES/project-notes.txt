I'm treating this as a 6 week project

2-3 features per person
  -light/dark mode
    -create globally scoped variablle to maintain state across entire app
    -make it a boolean value
    -true = light
    -false = dark
    -if(mode) light else dark
  -logo design/general ui/ux
  -integration of an external API
  -animation?
  -search feature
  -authentication
  -responsive design
    -would have to be more than just vanilla bootstrap
  -accessibility

end of week 7
  
one break week (will still be working)
  -maybe include a stretch goal

approach project iteratively

Project Flow/Collaboration
  branches matter
  NEVER push to main
  always be aware from where you're branching

MVP:
Inventory database completed
Front-facing part of website completed
Well designed UI/UX
Users can acquire basic items
Authentication

My action items:
logo
