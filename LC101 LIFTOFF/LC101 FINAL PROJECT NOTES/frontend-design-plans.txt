Guidelines

Heading texts should have slight negative spacing

50-75 characters for body test

normal paragraph around 18px

for text 600 pixels for desktop screen

dont over use font sizes to communicate hierarchy

stick with JUST TWO different font sizes and use font weight 
and subtle color changes to communicate hierarchy

"Whitespacs is to be regarded as an active element, not a passive background."

Group of elements -> whats their relationship? -> some have closer than others

use 1x measurements: a heading -> 1x -> a body -> 2x -> b heading -> 1x -> b body
